# pre-commit runs static analysis in the CI for this repo
#
# you can also use it to have the static analysis run incrementally on your commits;
#
# install:
#
#     pip install .[test]
#     pre-commit install
#
# after this, pre-commit will run automatically when you run `git commit`; it will
# flag any answers, and in the case of black / isort will automatically update
# your local files
#
# run on the whole repo: pre-commit run --all-files
# run a single hook:     pre-commit run --all-files black
